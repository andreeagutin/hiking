# Trail Mix

A fullstack application for tracking, managing, and sharing hiking routes.

## Production
- **Frontend:** https://hiking-high.netlify.app/
- **API:** https://hiking-1.onrender.com/api/hikes

---

## Overview

Trail Mix allows users to:
- Browse hikes publicly with search, filters, and a detail page per trail
- Track key metrics: distance, elevation, duration, difficulty
- Manage all data through a protected admin interface (CRUD)
- Upload trail photos via Cloudinary

---

## Architecture

```
Client (React + Vite)
        ↓
REST API (Node.js / Express)
        ↓
MongoDB Atlas
```

- Frontend communicates with backend via REST API
- Backend handles business logic, validation, and data access
- MongoDB stores structured hike data
- Images hosted on Cloudinary, URLs stored in DB
